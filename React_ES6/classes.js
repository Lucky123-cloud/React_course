// a class is like a function but instead of using the keyword 'function' we use the keyword 'class' and we add
// other properties using a constructor() method

class Car {
    constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
    }
}

// notice that we have used the 'C' in upppercase in class Car because that is the convention used for writing classes
